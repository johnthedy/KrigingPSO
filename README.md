# KrigingPSO
Reliability Assessment Using Kriging and metaheuristic optimization PSO

This MATLAB code calculate reliability of nonlinear complex problem, 14 problem is provided in G.m and problem.m
To include new problem from user, G.m and problem.m can be modified.

Use MAIN.m to run the code
To run MAIN.m, make sure dace toolbox has been added.

Kriging algorithm used in this study is solely taken from DACE toolbox
